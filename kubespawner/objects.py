    Make a k8s pod specification for running a user notebook.

    Parameters:
      - name:
        Name of pod. Must be unique within the namespace the object is
        going to be created in. Must be a valid DNS label.
      - image_spec:
        Image specification - usually a image name and tag in the form
        of image_name:tag. Same thing you would use with docker commandline
        arguments
      - image_pull_policy:
        Image pull policy - one of 'Always', 'IfNotPresent' or 'Never'. Decides
        when kubernetes will check for a newer version of image and pull it when
        running a pod.
      - run_as_uid:
        The UID used to run single-user pods. The default is to run as the user
        specified in the Dockerfile, if this is set to None.
      - fs_gid
        The gid that will own any fresh volumes mounted into this pod, if using
        volume types that support this (such as GCE). This should be a group that
        the uid the process is running as should be a member of, so that it can
        read / write to the volumes mounted.
      - env:
        Dictionary of environment variables.
      - volumes:
        List of dictionaries containing the volumes of various types this pod
        will be using. See k8s documentation about volumes on how to specify
        these
      - volume_mounts:
        List of dictionaries mapping paths in the container and the volume(
        specified in volumes) that should be mounted on them. See the k8s
        documentaiton for more details
      - cpu_limit:
        Float specifying the max number of CPU cores the user's pod is
        allowed to use.
      - cpu_guarentee:
        Float specifying the max number of CPU cores the user's pod is
        guaranteed to have access to, by the scheduler.
      - mem_limit:
        String specifying the max amount of RAM the user's pod is allowed
        to use. String instead of float/int since common suffixes are allowed
      - mem_guarantee:
        String specifying the max amount of RAM the user's pod is guaranteed
        to have access to. String ins loat/int since common suffixes
        are allowed
      - node_selector:
        Dictionary of node selector labels for matching.
